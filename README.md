## Description

This is the beginning of a scalable project that connects users for the purpose of distributing food, medicine, and related items. Here is the Current Data Schema:



This product intends to connect urban farmers, gleaners, food banks, foodies without ample resources, and anyone else interested in locally raised food.  It will implement mapping data to connect people to the most convenient resources and incorporate existing resources, such as fallingfruit.org into the data.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

At this point use will require an IDE and a program such as POSTMAN to see the Data Model.  The app currently uses Java with PostgreSQL tables.  You can expect a full front-end incorporating Javascript and Android in the future.
